Script to set up a new server with Coolify, CrowdSec, rate limiting, and some other things.

CrowdSec is included and should work out of the box with any service. It also supports Cloudflare proxying.

Rate limiting can be configured in [proxy/docker-compose.yml](proxy/docker-compose.yml). There is an existing snippet for rate limiting on WordPress websites. (You would use `- caddy_0.1_import=wordpress_rate_limit` in the labels section of the service.)

```bash
apt update && apt install gpg git unzip -y && git clone https://github.com/BOOST-Creative/coolify-setup.git --depth 1 /tmp/cs && /tmp/cs/setup.sh
```

**Notes:**

- You should only use ed25519 keys to connect to the server via SSH.
- The server runs Watchtower to keep containers up to date, so it's a good idea to use version tags to keep things from breaking.

## Initial Coolify setup

After running the script and logging back in via SSH, you can access the Coolify web interface at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Create your account, then go to Servers > localhost > Configuration and change the port to your chosen SSH port.

In the Proxy tab, stop the proxy and switch to use Caddy. You may need to `sudo systemctl restart docker` to get it to stick.

After the proxy is switched to Caddy, replace the entire proxy configuration with the content of [proxy/docker-compose.yml](proxy/docker-compose.yml).

Finally, click `Dynamic Configurations` and add the following to access Coolify from outside the server:

**admin.caddy**

```
https://coolify.example.com {
    import crowdsec
    rate_limit {
        log_key
        zone login_attempts {
            match {
                path /login
                method POST
            }
            key {client_ip}
            window 1m
            events 2
        }
    }
    tls internal
    handle /app/* {
        reverse_proxy coolify-realtime:6001
    }
    handle /terminal/ws {
        reverse_proxy coolify-realtime:6002
    }
    reverse_proxy coolify:8080
}
```

Please do not change the admin URL directly on the Coolify Settings page.

## CrowdSec

CrowdSec is configured with [a Caddy bouncer](https://github.com/hslatman/caddy-crowdsec-bouncer) to block malicious traffic at the proxy level.

It processes logs directly from Caddy, so should work with any service as long as it includes the proper label:

```yaml
labels:
  - caddy_0.0_import=crowdsec
```

### CrowdSec CLI

You can use the `cscli` command to manage the crowdsec instance. Prefix with `docker exec crowdsec` to run it in the crowdsec container.

<https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/cscli/>

#### Example commands

**Metrics**

```bash
docker exec crowdsec cscli metrics
```

**Ban / Unban IP**

```bash
# ban ip
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions add --ip 1.2.3.4
# delete ban
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions delete --ip 1.2.3.4
# ban range
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions add --range 1.2.3.0/24
# customize length of ban (default is 4h)
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions add --ip 1.2.3.4 --duration 1w
```

**List recent alerts**

```bash
docker exec crowdsec cscli alerts list -h
```

**List current bans**

```bash
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions list
```

#### Manually adding a ban

```bash
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions add --ip <ip>
```

## Firewall (UFW)

This setup uses UFW with [ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker).

The firewall is configured to allow HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (your chosen port).

If you need to allow ingress on other ports, do this:

```bash
PORT=45876 && sudo ufw allow $PORT && sudo ufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port $PORT
```

If you need to block an IP range, do this, but be careful not to block Cloudflare IPs:

```bash
IP_RANGE="45.135.232.0/24" && sudo ufw prepend deny from $IP_RANGE && sudo ufw route prepend deny from $IP_RANGE
```

<!-- After making changes to UFW rules, you need to save them to persist across reboots:

```bash
sudo ufw save
``` -->

## TLS

We're using the Caddy proxy for Coolify because it's a little easier to run services with self-signed certs (`caddy_0.tls=internal`) and set up redirects. Generally we want to use a self-signed cert and strict SSL through Cloudflare so we don't need to worry about expiring certs.

If a service is not proxied through Cloudflare, removing `caddy_0.tls=internal` and restarting the service will generate a cert.

## TODO

- [ ] IP whitelist.
